Contain datasets of NCAA basketball match during 2015-2019 season. With this dataset I tried to predict the number of wins using four-factor analysis and linear regression model.
The insight and analysis of this datasets can be seen in my kaggle kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/shizenkenmae/win-prediction-using-four-factors.
